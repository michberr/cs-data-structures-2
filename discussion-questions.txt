Recursion:

1) Recursion is a function structure that makes a call to itself. It operates
using a call stack to keep track of the order of function calls (LIFO). It is
an alternative to iteration.

2) It is necessary to have a base case in order to exit out of a recursive function,
otherwise the function would be called forever.

Graphs:

1) A graph is a set of nodes connected to one another by edges. Nodes can 
connect to many others, and nodes can form closed loops within a larger graph.


2) Trees have a hierarchy. Graphs are a more flexible structure 
and have no implicit hierarchy. Graphs can be directed or undirected.

3) A social network like friends on facebook.

Performance of Different Data Structures:
========================================
Python List: O(n), O(n), O(1)
Linked List: O(n), O(n), O(1), O(1), O(1), O(n)
Doubly-Linked List: O(n), O(n), O(1), O(1), O(1), O(1)
Queue (as Array): O(1), O(n)
Queue (as LL or DLL): O(1), O(1)
Stack (as Array, LL, or DLL): O(1), O(1)
Deque (As DLL): O(1), O(1), O(1), O(1)   

Set: O(1), O(1), O(1), O(n), medium
Binary Search Tree: O(logn), O(logn), O(logn), O(n), little
Tree: O(n), O(1), O(1), O(n), little

Sorting:

1) Bubble sort "bubbles" the largest item in a list over to the right. It 
starts on the left and successively compares pairs of items, making swaps
so that the largest number ends up on the end. It then repeats, starting from the left, until all items are sorted. Each round you have 1 less swap to make because you are assured that everything moved to the right is perfectly sorted. 

2) Mergesort works by splitting a list in half recursively until it reaches
a single item (which is inherently sorted). On the way back up the call stack,
mergesort compares the left and right sub-lists and merges them so they are sorted.

3) Quicksort works by selecting a random number from the list - this becomes
the pivot. The algorithm then moves all numbers less than the pivot to the left,
and all numbers greater than the pivot to the right. The algorithm repeats recursively, finding new pivots to the left and right of the last pivot and sorting the sub-lists until it reaches the base case of a single item. At this point,
the whole list is sorted.
